The Habari version of Syte differs from the original in that is allows you to configure it all within the theme of Habari itself.

Most settings are done in the theme configuration page itself.

There are a few exceptions:

1.  The brief "bio" and name under the image on the sidebar is taken from the "Name and Tagline" section under Menu -> Options
2.  The Portrait comes from the "admin" user's profile as configured in  Users -> "admin name"

// TODO:
The plugin adds a new field to this page too for the bio image and tags.
